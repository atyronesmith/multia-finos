Market Sizing Frameworks for Startup Evaluation

Top-Down Approach (TAM-SAM-SOM):
- Total Addressable Market (TAM): The total global revenue opportunity if 100% market share were achieved. Usually sourced from industry reports.
- Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): The portion of TAM that your product can realistically serve given geography, pricing, and feature constraints.
- Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): The realistic market share achievable in the near term (3-5 years). Typically 1-5% of SAM for startups.

Bottom-Up Approach:
Start with unit economics and scale up. Number of potential customers × average revenue per customer = market size estimate. More credible than top-down for investor presentations.

Market Growth Rate:
- Hypergrowth markets (>25% CAGR): AI, climate tech, space tech
- Fast growth (15-25% CAGR): Fintech, healthtech, cybersecurity
- Moderate growth (5-15% CAGR): SaaS, e-commerce, edtech
- Slow growth (<5% CAGR): Traditional retail, legacy enterprise

Timing Indicators:
- Technology readiness: Is the enabling technology mature enough?
- Regulatory environment: Are regulations enabling or blocking?
- Customer readiness: Are customers aware of the problem and willing to pay?
- Infrastructure: Is the necessary infrastructure (internet, mobile, cloud) in place?

Competition Analysis:
- Blue ocean: No direct competitors, new category creation
- Fragmented market: Many small players, consolidation opportunity
- Oligopoly: Few dominant players, differentiation required
- Monopoly: One dominant player, extremely difficult to enter

Market Validation Signals:
- Existing spending on workarounds or inferior solutions
- Growing search volume for related terms
- Venture capital investment in adjacent companies
- Regulatory changes creating new opportunities
- Technology cost curves making new solutions viable
