Risk Assessment Frameworks for Startups

PEST Analysis (External Risks):
- Political: Government policy changes, trade restrictions, political stability
- Economic: Interest rates, inflation, economic cycles, currency fluctuations
- Social: Demographics shifts, cultural trends, consumer behavior changes
- Technological: Disruption risk, technology adoption curves, infrastructure changes

Porter's Five Forces (Competitive Risks):
1. Threat of new entrants: How easy is it for competitors to enter?
2. Bargaining power of suppliers: Can suppliers squeeze margins?
3. Bargaining power of buyers: Can customers demand lower prices?
4. Threat of substitutes: Are there alternative solutions?
5. Industry rivalry: How intense is existing competition?

Startup-Specific Risk Categories:

Product Risk: Can you build the product? Will it work as intended?
- Technical feasibility uncertainty
- Development timeline risk
- Quality and reliability concerns

Market Risk: Will customers want it? Will they pay enough?
- Product-market fit uncertainty
- Pricing model validation
- Customer acquisition scalability

Financial Risk: Can you fund it? Will unit economics work?
- Runway and funding availability
- Revenue model viability
- Cash flow timing mismatches

Team Risk: Can this team execute?
- Key person dependencies
- Skill gaps in critical areas
- Founder dynamics and alignment

Regulatory Risk: Will regulations help or hinder?
- Compliance requirements and costs
- Licensing and certification needs
- Data privacy and security mandates

Risk Scoring Matrix:
- Critical (9-10): Existential threat, could kill the company
- High (7-8): Significant impact, requires active mitigation
- Medium (4-6): Manageable with planning and monitoring
- Low (1-3): Minor impact, standard business operations
