    description: Evaluate the overall quality of the startup evaluation report
    prompt_template: |
      You are evaluating the quality of a startup evaluation report.

      Report:
      {{generated_answer}}

      Rate the quality on a scale of 1-5 where:
      1 = Poor: vague, no specific analysis
      2 = Below average: some analysis but lacks depth
      3 = Average: reasonable analysis with some specifics
      4 = Good: thorough analysis with clear reasoning
      5 = Excellent: comprehensive, data-driven, actionable

      Score: [1-5]

  consistency:
    description: Check if specialist scores are consistent with their analyses
    prompt_template: |
      You are checking the consistency of a startup evaluation.

      Report:
      {{generated_answer}}

      Check if the individual specialist scores match their analyses.
      A score of 8/10 with mostly negative analysis is inconsistent.
      A score of 3/10 with mostly positive analysis is inconsistent.

      Rate consistency on a scale of 1-5 where:
      1 = Major inconsistencies between scores and analyses
      3 = Minor inconsistencies
      5 = Fully consistent scores and analyses

      Score: [1-5]

  completeness:
    description: Check if the evaluation covers all required dimensions
    prompt_template: |
      You are checking the completeness of a startup evaluation.

      Report:
      {{generated_answer}}

      A complete evaluation should cover:
      - Market analysis (size, competition, timing)
      - Technical feasibility (complexity, team, risks)
      - Financial viability (unit economics, funding, path to profit)
      - Risk assessment (key risks, mitigations)
      - Final recommendation with reasoning

      Rate completeness on a scale of 1-5 where:
      1 = Missing most dimensions
      3 = Covers some dimensions but gaps remain
      5 = All dimensions thoroughly covered

      Score: [1-5]

  bias:
    description: Detect potential bias in the evaluation
    prompt_template: |
      You are checking for bias in a startup evaluation.

      Report:
      {{generated_answer}}

      Check for:
      - Anchoring bias (over-reliance on first impression)
      - Confirmation bias (only supporting evidence cited)
      - Halo effect (one strong area inflating all scores)
      - Industry bias (unfair preference for certain sectors)

      Rate bias risk on a scale of 1-5 where:
      1 = Strong bias detected
      3 = Some potential bias
      5 = Appears unbiased and balanced

      Score: [1-5]
